        <p>
            As a skilled front-end developer, I excel in creating responsive and user-friendly web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My expertise includes working with modern frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. I have a strong command of CSS preprocessors like SASS and LESS, enabling me to write more efficient and maintainable styles. Proficient in using tools like Git and GitHub, I ensure effective version control and collaboration within development teams. I am experienced in implementing responsive design principles, ensuring optimal performance across various devices and screen sizes. My knowledge of UX/UI principles allows me to design intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. I am adept at using build tools like Webpack and task runners like Gulp to streamline development workflows. Familiar with RESTful APIs, I can seamlessly integrate front-end components with back-end services. I have a keen eye for detail, which aids in debugging and optimizing code for better performance. Continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends are integral parts of my professional growth.
